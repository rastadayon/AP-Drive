# AP-Drive

This repository contains C++ code for AP-Drive, a web application similar to Dropbox.

Main focus of this project is **Object-Oriented design** principles.

AP-Drive is a web hosting service provider that allows you to sync files across multiple computers or between multiple users over the Internet. The functionality of the program I have implemented is similar to the Linux operating system file system, which is also able to load and upload files over the network.

In the application, users first sign up in the system and then they can log in to their accounts and use their AP-Drive profile.


I have used [APHTTP](https://github.com/UTAP/APHTTP) as the webframe work for implementation of the graphical interface.
